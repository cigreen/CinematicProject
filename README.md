# CinematicProject
Cinematic project for CMPM 120.

Key requirements for this assignment:
- **3+ scenes**: Intro, Logo Scene, Main Menu, Prologue, and Meet the Cast scenes.
- **2+ audio assets**: Overarching music and "selection" sound. Song is 'The Pyre' by Kevin Macleod, edited down by myself in Reaper. Selection sound was created by me in Reaper.
- **2+ image assets**: Character portraits, world map, opening logo, and parchment background. Character portraits by Shay @narcophilia on Instagram, cropped by myself. The World Map was created by myself using Inkarnate, an online fantasy map maker. The Parchment background was found on Freepik, and was enlarged and stretched by myself. Opening logo was created on Sketch.io by myself.
- **2+ geometric shapes**: Two rectangles, one containing the words "Continue" and the other containing the words "The End".
- **1+ logotype**: "Threads of Fate" title. Title was created in cooltext.com.
- **1+ multi-line text**: The prologue story paragraph.
- **1+ fading animation**: Transitions between scenes.
- **1+ object motion animation**: "The End" rectangle and words slide onto the screen from the right.

Story and cinematic based on the Dungeons and Dragons game I’ve been running for my friends for almost 3 years now. Each character was created by each of them, and still played to this day. Special shoutout to them, the adventuring party known as “The Wingbois”.
